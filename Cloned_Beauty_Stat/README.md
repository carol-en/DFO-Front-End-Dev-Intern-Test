**1.a) Explain your method?**

The first thing I did was research applications that can clone web sites using a mac OS. After some search I settled on using Httrack to clone the web site. I accomplished this by running Httrack via the command line terminal.

Once done I hope it in visual stupid code and launch the site using a simple python server command _python â€“m http.server 8000,_ then I would open it up on _localhost:8000_ and view the site offline.

**2.b) How you would minimize the errors?**

Make sure to read the documentation for Httrack, inevitably, some errors may occur and the best thing to do is search only for solutions if re-checking the documentation fails. If that fails and research fails, ask a senior developer for assistance.

**3.c) If you would need to eliminate a scripts explain
why**

I think this would really depend on just what the cloned site is being used for. If all that's needed are images or styling, then the Javascript files could be removed.

**4.D) If you would replace scripts explain how & why**

I think the only thing off the top of my head would be whatever is adding _?language_id=1_ to some of the .PNG files on their web site as for whatever reason that additional piece of data gave me a bit of trouble when it came to clone the site without errors.

**5.e) Clone the the page**
