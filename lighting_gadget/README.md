# [Lightning Gadget](https://lightning-gadget.herokuapp.com/)

The tools I used to build the site up from the ground up was vanilla HTML, **SASS**, and **Bootstrap**. My reasonings for that is because I already knew going in to the music app that I was use ReactJS for it. So for this challenge I chose not to use a library for it. For the styling I chose Bootstrap mostly for practice using it again as I had not for a long while. My personal preference is not using frameworks like Bootstrap or Bulma but I do practice with them because businesses do like using them. I used SASS as well to help make the styling management a bit easier and faster due to limited time.

I also used icons from **Font Awesome** for custom shapes like triangles and check marks. I also used **Google Fonts** for custom fonts to help match the images better.

## Challenges

I did not find much challenge in creating the website besides when implementing Bootstrap. It was more of a rusty sort of thing but after a while I recalled how it works so this is no issue to me.
