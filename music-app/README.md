# [Musi - Call](https://musi-call.herokuapp.com/)

Simple app to search up musicians and get information about them. It was created using ReactJS, Bulma, and Axios with some Google Fonts for extra customization. I also have used Heroku for deployment & GIT  for version control.

- **ReactJS** - I went for React over writing vanilla HTML & Javascript due to limited time, set up and component creation was quick and easy.
- **Bulma & Axios** - For the same reasons as above, they helped speed up the coding process.

## Challenges
As of recent a good amount of projects I had taken up moved me away from using APIs so picking it back up took longer than I would have liked but was also expected. Remembering what was needed to update forms in React, to correctly access the AudioDB API and make a search for both artist information and album list took me a while to get correctly to work. In the end I got it and the use of Axios helped in that regard with how simple and streamlined it is to use it.

## Improvements
If I were to have more time I would have re-factor several things:

- **Search Logic**: At the moment the search system is very simple, I would re-factor it to, if there are no search result: return a card saying as much rather than the search function not going through at all. I would also  make an advanced system of as you type in words a list of artists appear and vanish the more specific you type.

- **Information**: I would add more information like genre, full name, band member names, year of formation. Albums would be links that would expand to list songs. Biography would be properly broken up into paragraphs and be a bit easier to read. Add links to social medias too.

- **Styling**:  I would clean up the style, make things look a bit nicer than they currently look. Perhaps add some CSS animation to smooth actions out to look & feel more sleek.
